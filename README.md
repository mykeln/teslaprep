This is a comprehensive guide on preparing for, taking delivery of, and owning a Tesla Model 3.

I couldn't find a good resource for the soup-to-nuts process of buying a Model 3, so I [made one] [1].

## Start
Congratulations! You've configured a Model 3. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

You'll receive an email from Tesla saying something to the effect of "We'll be in touch!" Do not get financing quotes at this time. They expire after 30-days, and you will need to re-run credit checks.

Depending on your financing choice during configuration, you'll see an "Edit Design" button on your account page all the way up until your car starts being built (this can be in as little as ten days before taking delivery). If you elected the "Cash" option for financing, your "Edit Design" button will disappear immediately, but it is still accessible by visiting https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/edit-design/RNXXXXXXX. Use this link to (relatively) officially check the status of your order up to 7 days before your delivery date.

### First contact
You will eventually be contacted by a Tesla Delivery Advisor/Scheduler who will confirm your delivery date. Make sure your Tesla account reflects this date.

You'll want to get your home charging solution worked out at this point. If you drive fewer than 70 miles per day, a regular wall outlet should be just fine. If you're driving more than that, and a [Tesla Wall Connector](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector) will give you peace of mind. Many states offer a  [tax rebate](https://www.chargepoint.com/blog/electric-car-home-charger-rebates/) for the parts and labor of most charger installs.

### <30 days before delivery
Now is the time to get financing quotes from credit unions, banks, etc. Whatever quotes you get, if your credit history is excellent, use [Lightstream](https://www.lightstream.com/) to get an unsecured cash loan. They will beat any approved rate you send them.

Ensure you have the routing/account number of the account(s) you will be transferring funds from on delivery day (especially important on weekends).

### <10 days before delivery
If applicable, finalize your financeer.

Your "Edit Design" button and/or back-door link should stop working. If it doesn't, your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

### <7 days before delivery
Check your account for an assigned Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA). If they are not showing up, the back-door method is to try buying a [Tesla Wall Connector](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/vehicle-accessories/model-s_x_3-wall-connector.html). When you're checking out, if it says "No VIN assigned," you truly do not have a VIN. Your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

If you have a VIN, call your insurance to schedule the coverage date.

## Before delivery day, you should:
1.  Watch the [Model 3 walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process.
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these pages go over details on financing, trade-ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  [Get a home charger installed](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation). Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.
5.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
6.  Read [What They Don't Tell You When You Buy an Electric Car](http://10ways.com/save/travel/car/what-they-dont-tell-you-when-you-buy-an-electric-car/9792)
7.  Grab a [good tire inflator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224N1U?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAR8J).
8.  Join the [official Tesla forum](https://forums.tesla.com/), the unofficial [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/), and [r/teslamotors](http://reddit.com/r/teslamotors) subreddit.

## Delivery day - before heading to Delivery Center:
If you haven't had any contact with a Delivery Advisor/Scheduler since "First Contact," before you drive anywhere, call the Tesla location where you're supposed to be picking up your car and verify it's indeed ready to go. There have been reports of people driving hours to pick up their Tesla only to be told their car isn't even in production yet.

1.  Have the Tesla app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driver’s license.
3.  If your car will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details.  If you are financing your car, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Tesla should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your Model 3 is insured.
6.  Since the delivery area where you will inspect your Model 3 may be dark, bring a flashlight.

## Delivery day - arrival at Delivery Center:
After checking in with a Tesla employee, you'll likely be waiting around for a while. It's rare for a Tesla delivery center to _not_ be busy. Expect to wait for 2 hours or more before you're taken to see your car.

*NOTE: Do not sign final documents, or wire funds, until a full vehicle inspection is completed.*

## Delivery day - VEHICLE INSPECTION CHECKLIST
### SECTION A - Verify pre-delivery vehicle records
1.  Check for the correct full name and address on your paperwork.
2.  Confirm the car's VIN matches your paperwork.

4.  Verify that the car's Moroney record matches your configuration.

### SECTION B - Exterior inspection
1.  Verify that the car's body color, interior, and wheels match what you configured.
2.  Inspect body exterior paint for defects. *NOTE: This should really be the only item which should cause you to reject a delivery; most other issues can be easily addressed in a separate service visit.*
3.  Inspect vehicle underside (front and rear) for signs of scraping, or damage.
4.  Check for any obvious body panel misalignment, or large gaps.
5.  Inspect wheel rims for damage.

12.  Ensure door windows auto-close completely when doors are closed.
13.  Check for front license plate bracket (if applicable in your state).
14.  Check all front and rear exterior lights for signs of internal condensation.
15.  With all doors open, inspect the weather seals around door gaps and windows. *NOTE: Some deliveries have reported seals being "overlapped" incorrectly. This is easily fixed by hand in a few seconds, but worth noting.*

### SECTION C - Interior inspection
1.  Check for any error messages on the display screen.
2.  Touch the "Tesla T" at the top of the screen to bring up the "About Your Tesla" window. Tap the unicorn drawing to access the Sketch Pad. Leave the Sketch Pad up for a minute to make sure there are no phantom touches happening on the display.
3.  Gently test the driver and passenger door emergency release.
4.  Check all 4 windows to ensure they open and close properly.
5.  Inspect interior seat upholstery, door surfaces, dash, headliner & carpets (including passenger compartment, frunk, and trunk).
6.  Check left and right clothing hook operation.
7.  Check all seat belts for proper operation.
8.  Check the rear seats for proper fold-down operation.
9.  Test the sound system to ensure all speakers are working (move fade/balance to all four points to verify)
10.  Test the steering wheel position controls to ensure proper operation.
11.  Press the center of the steering wheel to make sure the car's horn works.
12.  Test the windshield wipers.

11.  All door latch button lights.
12.  All door window button lights.
13.  Steering wheel control lights.
14.  Glovebox light (check glovebox opening and closing).
15.  Frunk light.
16.  Trunk lights (2).
17.  Fog lights.
19.  Headlights (low & high-beam).
20.  Front park lights.

2.  Check charge port indicator light.
3.  Ensure vehicle will accept a charge.
4.  Check mobile charging kit. Test it to ensure it works.
	4a.  J1772 adapter.
	4b.  NEMA 5-15 120v adapter.
	4c.  Mobile Connector with cable.
	
### SECTION F - Verify region-specific equipment
1.  Maryland deliveries should include Tesla's official inflation kit.

### SECTION G - Inspect pairing connectivity
1.  Test both key cards to ensure they work with your car. Keep one key card on your person in case the phone app does not operate properly.
2.  Pair your smartphone to your car over Bluetooth.

## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your car is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. *NOTE: Some owners have reported cars being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the car not being marked as "Delivered" in the network.*
2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is has a reputation of rectifying these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*

3.  Go and try a supercharger (also a good excuse for a first drive)
4.  Consider having the paint protected with ceramic paint protection, which will help prevent scratches, stone chips, etc.
5.  Install a [dash camera](https://teslatap.com/articles/ultimate-tesla-dashcam-guide/). Many owners opt for the [BlackVue](https://www.blackvue.com/) brand. UPDATE: This is now part of the car with the V9 update.

7.  [Learn how to properly wash your car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWmtLSQYbys).
8.  Be aware the Model 3 does not come with a spare tire.
9.  When your registration arrives, check that it's the correct model listed (LR AWD, etc.), as it could affect selling your car in the future, insurance coverage, etc.
10. Respond to the surveys that Tesla periodically sends. This the best way that you can directly impact improvements to the car and company.
