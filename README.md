## Configuration complete
Congratulations! You've configured your Tesla. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

You'll receive an email from Tesla saying something to the effect of "We'll be in touch!" Do not get financing quotes at this time. Quotes expire after 30 days, at which time you will need to rerun the credit check, which may lower your score.

Depending on your financing choice during configuration, you'll see an "Edit Design" button on your account page all the way up until your vehicle starts being built (this can be in as little as 7 days before taking delivery). If you elected to use the "Cash" option for financing, your "Edit Design" button will disappear immediately, but it is still accessible by visiting `https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/edit-design/RNXXXXXXX`. Use this link to (relatively) officially check the status of your order up to 7 days before your delivery date.


## First contact
You will eventually be contacted by a Tesla Delivery Advisor/Scheduler who will confirm your delivery date. Make sure your Tesla account reflects this date.

You'll want to get your home charging solution worked out at this point. There are many options depending on your needs:

| Level   | Voltage | Rate of Charge                                         |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | 120V    | 2-5 miles per hour of charging (regular outlet)        |
| Level 2 | 240V    | 9-52 miles per hour of charging ([Tesla Wall Connector](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector)) |
| Level 3 | 480V    | 200-1000 miles per hour of charging (Supercharging)    |

Level 3 isn't really a home charging option; it's just here for comparison. If you drive fewer than 70 miles per day, a regular wall outlet should be just fine. If you're driving more than that, and a Tesla Wall Connector will give you peace of mind. Many states offer a  [tax rebate](https://www.chargepoint.com/blog/electric-car-home-charger-rebates/) for the parts and labor of most charging solution installs.

Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). Tesla partners with reputable local contractors to install the Wall Connector product in your home, but these contractors typically charge higher than average rates. Any experienced electrician should be able to do the work at a much lower price; it's a relatively simple job. You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.


## 30 days before your delivery date
Now is the time to get financing quotes from credit unions, banks, etc. Whatever quotes you get, if your credit history is excellent, use [Lightstream](https://www.lightstream.com/) to get an unsecured cash loan. They will beat any approved rate you send them.

Ensure you have the routing/account number of the account(s) you will be transferring funds from on delivery day (especially important on weekends when banks are closed).

You may also want to order your [accessories](https://shop.tesla.com/category/vehicle-accessories) now, as they are often sold out. Yes, it'll feel weird to have all weather floor mats with no vehicle, but it'll be worth it in the end. Not sure what to get? See the "Must-Have Accessories" section in the appendix.


## 10 days before your delivery date
Your "Edit Design" button and/or back-door link should stop working and you should finalize your financeer at this time. If the link still works, your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.


## 7 days before your delivery date
Check your Tesla account for an assigned Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA). If they are not showing up, the back-door method is to try buying a [Tesla Wall Connector](https://shop.tesla.com/product/wall-connector). When you're checking out, if it says "No VIN assigned," you truly do not have a VIN. Your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

If you have a VIN assigned, call your insurance to schedule the coverage date for your delivery day.

Some states require a vehicle insepction be completed at a state certified inspection facility, after you take ownership of the car. Rules vary by state,but if you have previously owned cars in the state you live in, the process should be the same as you have always known. If you recently moved to a new state, this is something you want to make sure you look in to.


## Anytime before delivery day
1.  Watch [Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos) or [Model Y](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-y-videos) walkthrough videos. These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process.
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support), these pages go over details on financing, trade-ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  Download [Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/model_3_owners_manual_north_america_en.pdf) or [Model Y](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/model_y_owners_manual_north_america_en.pdf) owners manuals. It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
5.  Grab a [good tire inflator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224N1U?tag=mykelteslapre-20).
6.  Join the [official Tesla forum](https://forums.tesla.com/), the unofficial [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/), and [r/teslamotors](http://reddit.com/r/teslamotors) subreddit.


## Delivery day
### Before heading to the Delivery Center:
If you haven't had any contact with a Delivery Advisor/Scheduler since "First Contact," before you drive to pick your vehicle up, call the Tesla delivery location's direct number, and verify that your vehicle is indeed ready to go. There have been reports of people driving hours to pick up their Tesla only to be told their vehicle isn't even in production yet!

1.  Have the Tesla app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driver’s license.
3.  If your vehicle will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details.  If you are financing, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Tesla should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your Model 3 is insured.
6.  Since the delivery area where you will inspect your Model 3 may be dark, bring a flashlight.
7.  Bring a USB drive (32gb minimum recommended) to set up [Sentry mode and the dash cam](https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9#dashcam).

### Arrival at the Delivery Center:
After checking in with a Tesla employee, you'll likely be waiting around for a while. It's rare for a Tesla delivery center to _not_ be busy. Expect to wait for 2 hours or more before you're taken to see your vehicle.

*NOTE: Do not sign final documents, or wire funds, until a full vehicle inspection is completed.*


# VEHICLE INSPECTION CHECKLIST
- [Model 3 delivery checklist](model_3_checklist.md)
- [Model Y delivery checklist](model_y_checklist.md)


## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your vehicle is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. *NOTE: Some owners have reported vehicles being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the vehicle not being marked as "Delivered" in the network.*

2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is has a reputation of rectifying these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a vehicle you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*

### Before driving away, ask a Tesla rep:
1.  [How to charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bDGjIxmyNo) / [work a supercharger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srLjNqo7r20) / open the charge flap.
2.  Make sure the correct [closing technique for frunk is demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY8qpdawx5U).
3.  [Autopilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CLjUHTatYk) usage.
4.  [How to find superchargers](http://plugshare.com/) / other chargers.
5.  How to [open / move between apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgNNPdj7zp8) on the display.
6.  [Pair your phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJT0Du4BseM) and connect / reconnect Bluetooth.
8.  [Steering wheel buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1rHLE1l60A) / how to change what each do.
9.  [How to do a full reset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eLJYgcJN6I) of the main screen.
10. How to [adjust seating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgq9zBjpekE), [save profiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hprbqJwMqWM), have mirrors drop / not drop when reversing.
11. Review [all settings pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgNNPdj7zp8).
12. Use of the Android or iPhone [apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMD1TA-MdZY).
13. Where to find [roadside assistance](https://www.tesla.com/support/customer-support-roadside-assistance) info from the main screen.
14. Your local [service center](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States) support number.


## After your first drive
1.  **Keep driving!**
2.  Download [Plugshare](http://plugshare.com/) to find third-party charging stations.
3.  Go to try a supercharger (also a good destination for your first drive)
4.  Consider having the paint protected with ceramic paint protection, which will help prevent scratches, stone chips, etc.
5.  Consider alloy wheel insurance or protection.
6.  [Learn how to properly wash your vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWmtLSQYbys).
7.  Be aware that the Model 3 and Model Y do not come with a spare tire.
8.  When your registration arrives, check that it's the correct model listed (AWD/SR+/etc.), as it could affect selling your vehicle in the future, insurance coverage, etc.
9. Respond to the surveys that Tesla periodically sends. This is the best way that you can directly impact improvements to the vehicle and company.


# Appendix
## Must-Have Accessories
After a year and a half of Tesla ownership, here are the accessories I have found to be real upgrades that I haven't taken for granted:
1. All-weather floor mats [OEM (my recommendation)](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-all-weather-floor-liners), [aftermarket](https://www.amazon.com/3D-MAXpider-B07D9GMYG8?tag=mykelteslapre-20). I keep these in my vehicle year-round. It has helped preserve the "new car smell," and is easy to keep clean.
2. Wireless charging pad [OEM](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-wireless-phone-charger), [aftermarket](https://www.amazon.com/TapTes-Horizontally-Vertically-Smartphone-Compatible/dp/B07X2RJ2V4?tag=mykelteslapre-20). I have the aftermarket one installed in mine. No issues. Note that Tesla has revised their Model 3 center console to include a built-in wireless charger, so no mat is needed at all. The Model Y doesn't yet have this refresh, but it's expected to come soon.
3. A fast-write [USB stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBS74?tag=mykelteslapre-20) for Sentry and dashcam footage. I recommend one with a built-in lightning port to easily review footage on your iPhone.
4. A [vinyl wrap](https://www.abstractocean.com/model-3-center-console-vinyl-wrap/) for the center console. The factory console is piano black, which is impossible not to scratch. Vinyl wraps are easy to install and (arguably) look better than stock. Note that Tesla has revised their Model 3 center console which may make wraps less necessary.
