## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your car is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. *NOTE: Some owners have reported cars being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the car not being marked as "Delivered" in the network.*

2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.
